        Yeah, yeah
        Fool, you know how we do it (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
        Westside
        Comin' from the Westside
        Nothin' but the Westside (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
        
        [Verse 1: Ice Cube]
        Ain't nothin' goin' on but the bomb-ass rap song
        Hittin' all night long
        Just like me on the black and white ivory
        Gettin' six on artillery (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
        You don't want to see a G
        Break yo' ass like dishes
        Buster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes
        Runnin' from Lennox, up at Venice
        They wanna have me in stripes (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
        Like Dennis the Menace
        But that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'
        Fo'-hoppin', ass droppin', Coupe DeVille
        My troupe can kill, (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) fool I got skills
        So, back on up 'fore I check that chin
        Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'
        You gets no love and I thought you knew it
        Fool, you know how we do it</p>
        <p>[Refrain: Ice Cube & Evelyn King] <br>
            Comin' from the Westside <br>
            Comin' from the Westside <br> 
            Westside, comin' from the Westside <br>
            (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) <br>
            
            [Verse 2: Ice Cube] <br>
            Chillin' with the homies, smellin' the bud <br>
            Double-parked and I'm talkin' to Dub <br>
            About who got a plan, who got a plot <br>
            Who got got (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) <br>
            And who got shot <br>
            'Cause everybody knows that he got the info <br>
            Crazy Toones hangin' out the window <br>
            Fool, I got them bomb-ass tapes <br>
            Da Lench Mob (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) <br>
            "Planet of the Apes" <br>
            I'm down with Eiht and Watts Up <br>
            Kam and Solo, they got nuts <br>
            When Ice Cube write a sentence <br>
            I want The Bomb (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) <br>
            Just like George Clinton <br>
            S-K-P is down to catch a body <br>
            Put on "Knee Deep", we'll turn out your party <br>
            You gets no love and I thought you knew it <br>
            Fool, (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) you know how we do it</p>
