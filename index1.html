        Yeah, yeah
        Fool, you know how we do it (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
        Westside
        Comin' from the Westside
        Nothin' but the Westside (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
        
        [Verse 1: Ice Cube]
        Ain't nothin' goin' on but the bomb-ass rap song
        Hittin' all night long
        Just like me on the black and white ivory
        Gettin' six on artillery (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
        You don't want to see a G
        Break yo' ass like dishes
        Buster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes
        Runnin' from Lennox, up at Venice
        They wanna have me in stripes (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
        Like Dennis the Menace
        But that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'
        Fo'-hoppin', ass droppin', Coupe DeVille
        My troupe can kill, (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) fool I got skills
        So, back on up 'fore I check that chin
        Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'
        You gets no love and I thought you knew it
        Fool, you know how we do it</p>
